Facemash
==================================
Build a Complete NodeJS MVC Framework With powerful ExpressJS.
======================

The idea is to demonstrate a custom MVC architecture in the context of ExpressJS.

First I developed 'facemash' in php back at the university in 2013.
At the early days of 2016 i grew interest on NodeJS and decided to build a custom opinionated MVC framework on the top of powerful unopinionated expressJS.
So i thought why not develop 'facemash' for the 2nd time with this custom built framework.

## Installation

  - Download the source code.
  - create a mysql database named `facemash` with username = `root` & password = `""`
  - Run `yarn` or `npm install`
  - Run `npm start`
  - Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
